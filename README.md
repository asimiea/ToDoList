Beginning of a to do list project using python. Using specifically the tkinter library 

I would first start by making a command line To-Do List before implementing the GUI.<br />

 I have just completed the command line interface of the TO-DO list. Here is the functionality:

I have just finished creating a functional GUI, it is not the prettiest righ now but it is functional. <br />

I used a grid arrangement for the GUI what that means is, if the window is maximized or minimized the widgets remain in the same place<br />

In this next phase, I want to explore design techniques and better looking GUI's in python
